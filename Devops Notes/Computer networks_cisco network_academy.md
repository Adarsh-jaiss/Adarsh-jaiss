### Host rules
- All computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. Hosts can be called end devices. Some hosts are also called clients. However, the term hosts specifically refers to devices on the network that are assigned a number for communication purposes. This number identifies the host within a particular network. This number is called the Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address identifies the host and the network to which the host is attached.

- Servers are computers with software that allow them to provide information, like email or web pages, to other end devices on the network. Each service requires separate server software. For example, a server requires web server software in order to provide web services to the network. A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously to many different clients.

As mentioned before, clients are a type of host. Clients have software for requesting and displaying the information obtained from the server

- An example of client software is a web browser, like Chrome or FireFox. A single computer can also run multiple types of client software. For example, a user can check email and view a web page while instant messaging and listening to an audio stream. The table lists three common types of server software.

### Peer to Peer architecture
Client and server software usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to be used for both roles at the same time. In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a peer-to-peer network.

In the figure, the print sharing PC has a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection to the printer and a network connection, using a network interface card (NIC), to the file sharing PC.

The figure shows a small network with three devices. A printer is on the left, connected to a print sharing PC in the middle, which is also connected to a file sharing PC on the right. Under the topology is a list of the advantages and disadvantage of peer-to-peer networking. The advantages of peer-to-peer networking are: easy to set up, less complex, lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required, and can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers. The disadvantages of peer-to-peer networking are: no centralized administration, not as secure, not scalable, all devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance.
