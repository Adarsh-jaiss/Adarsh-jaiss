⏩ Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, interactivity, and transparency using small, cross-functional teams

⏩ The Agile Manifesto describes the core values of Agile:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

- Working software over comprehensive documentation

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

- Responding to change over following a plan

⏩ The waterfall approach is a structured, step-by-step process that can lead to problems not surfaced until later in development

⏩ Extreme Programming (XP) advocated an iterative approach that valued simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, and courage 

⏩ A Kanban system is characterized by visualizing workflow, limiting work in progress, managing and enhancing flow, making process policies explicit, and continuously improving a process

⏩ Working in small batches means delivering something useful quickly

⏩ An MVP is the cheapest/easiest thing you can do to test a hypothesis and learn 

⏩ Behavior Driven Development makes sure you are building the right thing

⏩ Test Driven Development makes sure you are building the thing right

⏩ Pair programming enables you to discover defects earlier and increase your code quality

⏩ The Gherkin syntax, which comes from a company called Cucumber, is a single syntax that developers and stakeholders can understand: given some set of preconditions, when an event occurs, then some outcome is observed.
