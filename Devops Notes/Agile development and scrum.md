⏩ Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, interactivity, and transparency using small, cross-functional teams

⏩ The Agile Manifesto describes the core values of Agile:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

- Working software over comprehensive documentation

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

- Responding to change over following a plan

⏩ The waterfall approach is a structured, step-by-step process that can lead to problems not surfaced until later in development

⏩ Extreme Programming (XP) advocated an iterative approach that valued simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, and courage 

⏩ A Kanban system is characterized by visualizing workflow, limiting work in progress, managing and enhancing flow, making process policies explicit, and continuously improving a process

⏩ Working in small batches means delivering something useful quickly

⏩ An MVP is the cheapest/easiest thing you can do to test a hypothesis and learn 

⏩ Behavior Driven Development makes sure you are building the right thing

⏩ Test Driven Development makes sure you are building the thing right

⏩ Pair programming enables you to discover defects earlier and increase your code quality

⏩ The Gherkin syntax, which comes from a company called Cucumber, is a single syntax that developers and stakeholders can understand: given some set of preconditions, when an event occurs, then some outcome is observed.


⏩ Scrum is a methodology that follows the Agile philosophy

⏩ The Scrum management framework:

- Provides structure through defined roles, meetings, rules, and artifacts

- Prescribes small, cross-functional, self-organizing teams

- Uses fixed-length iterations called sprints

- Produces a potentially shippable product increment with every iteration

⏩ The product owner represents stakeholders, articulates the product vision, and decides priorities, requirements, and readiness to ship

⏩ The scrum master coaches the team, promotes a cooperative environment, shields the team from interference, and unblocks impediments

⏩ The scrum team is small, dedicated, co-located, cross-functional, and self-managing

⏩ The scrum team negotiates commitments with the product owner — one sprint at a time

⏩ The scrum team has autonomy regarding how to reach commitments

⏩ Scrum produces a product backlog, a sprint backlog, and a completed — or done — increment

⏩ The Scrum events are sprint planning, daily Scrum meetings, sprints, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives

⏩ If done well, Scrum can: 

- Increase employee productivity and happiness

- Improve product quality

- Reduce time to market

- Enhance stakeholder satisfaction
