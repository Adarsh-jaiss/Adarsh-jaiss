#### 1. What does an operating system do?

   - Manage memory allocation for running applications
   - Process scheduling; managing CPU (central processing unit) allocation for running processes
   - Manage data storage
   - File management
   - Manage Input/Output (I/O), specifically process input from devices such as keyboards and touchpads, send output to a display
   - Manage peripherals such as printers and scanners

#### 2. Unix is a multi-user operating system. Under Unix, each user can access and share system resources such as memory. In contrast, other operating systems, like Windows, start a new session with distinct resources for each user.

#### 3. The portion of the operating system that handles the computer resources (CPU, RAM and devices) is referred to as the kernel. The initial version of the Linux kernel, created by Linus Torvalds, was written specifically for the Intel 80386 chip, a standard chip used in personal computers in the late 1980’s and 1990’s. The kernel has been ported to many different chip architectures since then.

There is also a set of standard software utilities that accompany the system that provide services such as a command line interpreters, file utilities and editors that we will cover in this module. Many of the Linux tools are written in C and are therefore machine independent.

When people refer to the Linux operating system they mean the kernel as well as the accompanying set of tools and libraries that is actually called GNU. Some people refer to this combination as GNU/Linux (as you see in the message of the day) but we will just refer to the kernel plus the utilities as Linux. For the most part the utilities that are packaged with Linux are functionally equivalent to the utilities with the same name in UNIX, but they have been rewritten.
