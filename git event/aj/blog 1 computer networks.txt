# **introduction**

As we are talking about ``computer networks`` we should first take a look at what actually is a ``network? ``
> so, in simple terms, it means computers connected together. 

while talking about networks we can't ignore the ``internet`` so, now you will ask that adarsh what is this internet stuff, i always hear this but I don't know its actual definition. so, 
 > internet is nothing but the collection of computer networks.

Now lets talk about ``protocols``. so,
 > protocols are the rules that determines how a particular data is is being send.

some of its examples are TCP , UDP , IP, HTTP, etc. These protocols are created by internet societies.

Now , you might think that what is ``WWW (world wide web)``? so, 
> WWW is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by url's which may be interlinked by the hyperlinks and are acessible over the internet.

# **protocols**

- TCP (transmission control protocol) -
It insures the complete transfer of data from its source to its destination without getting corupted . it is used in sending mails.
- UDP (user datagram protocol)-
it is pretty fast than TCP,but some data might get lost or corrupted in the transmission. it is commonly used in video conferencing.
- HTTP (Hyper text transfer protocol) -
in this protocol, the data is being transferred between client and servers . it uses client server architecture. 
- IP (internet protocol) -
every single device on internet that can talk to each other have an ``ip address``.

``` format : 
                                       x.x.x.x    (x can have values between 0 to 25)
``` 

``img``

--Modem assigns these IP address through DHCP protocol.

## port numbers 
- ports are basically 16 bit numbers.
- all HTTP stuffs happens at port 80 .
- Range of port numbers is 0 to 65353
      in which         0 to 1023        - Reserved ports
                        1024 to 49152     - Registered for applications
                        49153 to 65353  - For our use

### Difference between IP address and port number
> IP address decides which device to send data or tells us which device we are working with and the port numbers are used to identify which application made that request or tells us with which application we are working with. 

## Types of Networks
1.  Lan - interconects computer within a limited area  such as residences, schools . eg: wifi, ethernet
2. Metropolitican area network - interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of a size of a metropolitican area (cities).
3. WAN - extends over large geographic area
4. SONET - synchronous optical networking used in submarines
5. Frame Relay -  it is a wave for connecting LAN to wide area.

## Topologies
Topologies are the methods in which computers are connected to each other . It allows us to understand the different elements of our network and where they connect.
There are mainly 6 types of topologies. let's see few of them
- Bus topology 
-->they are connected to a single backbone . 

 `img`

-->if one part gets broken,entire system will fail.

--> only 1 person at a time can send information.
                
    
- Ring topology 
--> here,every system commucates with one another.

                          img
--> if, one of the cables break, you won't be able to send data.

--> Lot of unnecessary calls.

-  star topology
img

--> There will be one central device that is connected to all computers.

## TCP/IP Model

It is basically known as internet protocol suite. There are 5 layers in TCP/ip Model .

1. Application layer
2.Transport layer
3. Network layer
4. Data link layer
5. Physical layer

# OSI Model


**UDP** 
it is a stateless protocol. let's understand this with an example.
    
                       img


**Processes** -
 > processes is like one of the feature of a program or a running instance .
**Thread**
> lighter version of process.
one process can have multiple running threads.


  





#### 1. Application layer
This is the layer where user interacts with with it. it consists of applications like web browsers,chat application,etc. It lies on or devices. It works on ``client -server architectre``. or `` peer to peer architecture``. 

now talking about the servers and the clients . so,
 > A server is a system that controls the website you are hosting & the client are the ones who are using & consuming these resources.

**Data centers** : A collection of servers is known as Data centers.

 **peer to peer architecture**

img
There is no dedicated server,they are just connected to each other. The main key advantage is rapid scalability. here, every single computer can be termed as client as  well as a server.
